This is the R project for the Thesis submitted in fullfilment of the Master of Science Degree in Data Analytics
at National College of Ireland, Dublin. 

The project implements various machine learning algorithms for forecasting and clustering of Electricity consumptions
of consumers in Ireland. *Data Files are not included in this repository* due to the privacy concerns. 

## Methods Implemented: 
Multiple Linear Regression 
Generalized Additive Models (6 + 3 Variations)
Decision Trees (CTREE and RPART) + ARIMA
Random Forest + ARIMA

Mean Representations and Fourier Representations of TS Data (Dimensionality Reduction)

Partitioning Around Medoids (Clustering)


## Results: 
Random Forest + ARIMA gave highest accuracy for Forecasting aggregated load. 
Clustering Analysis could not be completed due to high volume of data and lack of computational power available.
